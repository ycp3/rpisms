# rpisms

Python script that uses Google Maps API to return step by step directions by text message to Rogers phone numbers.
Created because I don't have data and would like to have a method of getting directions sometimes.

Format, texting the email linked to the script:
"From (address 1) to (address 2) by (method: car, foot, transit, bike)"

Be sure to replace instances of PHONE_NUMBER, USERNAME, and PASSWORD accordingly.
